generations:
  - name: "First Generation (W10)"
    start_year: 1984

    description: "The first-generation Toyota MR2 represented Toyota's pioneering entry into the affordable mid-engine sports car segment, featuring a distinctive wedge-shaped design with angular lines, pop-up headlights, and compact dimensions. The name MR2 derived from 'Midship Runabout 2-seater,' reflecting its mid-engine, rear-wheel drive configuration that was unusual in its price range. Weighing approximately 2,300 pounds, the W10 MR2 emphasized handling precision over outright power, with a naturally aspirated 1.6-liter 4A-GE inline-four engine (shared with the Corolla GT-S) producing 112-128 horsepower depending on market and model year, paired with a five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic transmission. A supercharged version was added later in some markets, increasing output to 145 horsepower. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with well-bolstered seats, a three-spoke steering wheel, and distinctive features like a center console angled toward the driver. Despite its compact exterior, the cabin offered reasonable space for two occupants, while storage was provided in both front and rear trunks, albeit with limited capacity. Handling was the MR2's standout characteristic, with its mid-engine layout, fully independent MacPherson strut suspension, and lightweight construction creating a nimble, responsive driving experience that earned it acclaim from automotive journalists and driving enthusiasts. The first-generation MR2 successfully demonstrated that an affordable, reliable mid-engine sports car was viable, establishing the model's reputation for delivering exotic car driving dynamics at a fraction of the price."

  - name: "Second Generation (W20)"
    start_year: 1989
    end_year: 1999
    description: "The second-generation Toyota MR2 evolved the model with more rounded, exotic styling reminiscent of contemporary mid-engine supercars, particularly Ferrari designs—earning it the nickname 'baby Ferrari' in some circles. Significantly larger and heavier than its predecessor, the W20 MR2 offered enhanced performance, refinement, and features while maintaining the mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout that defined the nameplate. Base models featured a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 3S-GE inline-four producing approximately 165 horsepower, while the performance-oriented Turbo variant (available in North America and Japan) used a turbocharged 3S-GTE engine generating up to 200 horsepower in early models and up to 242 horsepower in later Japanese versions. Transmission options included a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic, with the latter not available on Turbo models. The interior offered improved comfort and equipment compared to the first generation, with better materials, more adjustability in the seating position, and enhanced noise insulation. The driving experience balanced sharper performance with improved refinement, though early models gained a reputation for challenging handling at the limit—an issue Toyota addressed with suspension revisions in 1993 that improved predictability. The second-generation MR2 demonstrated Toyota's commitment to the sports car segment during Japan's economic bubble period, delivering genuine performance and exotic styling at a relatively accessible price point, though still facing the same practical limitations inherent to the mid-engine, two-seater format. This generation's long production run—a full decade—spoke to its success and enduring appeal, with the turbocharged variants in particular developing a strong following among tuning enthusiasts."

  - name: "Third Generation (W30)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The third-generation Toyota MR2, marketed as the MR2 Spyder in North America and MR-S in Japan, represented a dramatic reimagining of the nameplate, downsizing to a lightweight, open-top roadster format clearly inspired by the successful Mazda Miata/MX-5. Significantly smaller and approximately 700-800 pounds lighter than its predecessor, the W30 MR2 returned to the first generation's philosophy of prioritizing handling agility over outright power. Available exclusively as a convertible with a manual folding soft top, the MR2 Spyder featured clean, minimalist styling with smooth curves, fixed headlights (replacing the pop-ups of previous generations), and a distinctive appearance with the top either up or down. Powered by a naturally aspirated 1.8-liter 1ZZ-FE inline-four mounted transversely behind the seats, the MR2 produced a modest 138 horsepower but offered lively performance due to its approximately 2,200-pound curb weight. Transmission options included a five-speed manual and later a six-speed sequential manual transmission (SMT) with paddle shifters—one of the first such transmissions in an affordable sports car. The interior was simple and focused on the driving experience, with minimal luxury features but supportive seats and well-placed controls. Storage space was extremely limited, with only a small compartment behind the engine and tiny bins behind the seats. The driving experience emphasized immediate response, exceptional agility, and the visceral connection between driver and machine rather than straight-line speed. While less powerful than its predecessors, the third-generation MR2 captured the pure sports car essence that had defined the original, providing an affordable mid-engine experience focused on driving enjoyment rather than practicality or specs. The model was discontinued after the 2005 model year in North America and 2007 globally without a direct replacement, marking the end of Toyota's mid-engine sports car era until the introduction of the GR Supra and eventual GR Corolla."
